This project is the final assignment in the course "Machine Learning for economist" at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, spring 2020.
For the project I replicated the main results of the paper:
> “Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment” by Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008)".


The full paper can be found [here](https://isps.yale.edu/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/ISPS08-001.pdf).


The project includes some model extensions and other Machine Learning methods that shed light on causality and heterogeneity questions.
Finally, using the same data, I built a prediction model (Logistic regression with regularizations, Random Forests, boosting, and principle component algorithms).
The model's performance was compared to pick the best one in terms of predicting power. Additionally, variable importance analysis was made.
