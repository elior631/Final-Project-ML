# Social Presure - Final project

This project is the final assignment in the course "Machine Learinng for economist" at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, spring 2020.
For the project I replicated the main results of the paper:
> “Social Pressure and Voter Turnout: Evidence from a Large-Scale Field Experiment” by Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008)".


The full paper can be found [here](https://isps.yale.edu/sites/default/files/publication/2012/12/ISPS08-001.pdf).
